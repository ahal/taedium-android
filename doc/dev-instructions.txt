These instructions are guidelines for developping the Taedium android app using eclipse. They are fairly basic and not at all comprehensive.

1.
a) Install the Android SDK and setup Eclipse by following the tutorial here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html
When choosing the SDK, make sure to get at least Android 2.3 (API ver 7). When you get to step 4, install the Google APIs addon.

2.
a) Open Eclipse and select 'File->New Project'.
b) In the wizard select create project from source and navigate to the 'path_to_repo/taedium' folder.
c) Continue through the wizard until you are finished.

3.
a) In Eclipse, go to 'Window->Android SDK and AVD Manager'
b) Click on Installed Packages. Make sure that you see both the SDK and the API addon you installed.
c) If you don't, you can install them under 'Available Packages'

4.
a) Click virtual devices and then click 'New'.
b) Enter a name for the virtual device and under target select the 'Google APIs' option.
c) Fill out the hardware specs as desired. Make sure to add touch and GPS support.
d) When finished click 'Create AVD' and exit.

5.
a) In Eclipse go to 'Project->Properties'.
b) Under 'Android' check 'Google APIs'
c) Under 'Java Build Path->Source' click Add Folder and check assets, src, gen and res.
d) Under 'Java Build Path->Library' click Add External Jar and add 'path_to_repo/third-party-resources/google-gson-1.7.1/gson-1.7.1.jar'
e) Click ok to exit.

6.
a) If your project still has errors, try highlighting the project root and pressing F5 to refresh. If that doesn't work, try right clicking the root and go to 'Android Tools->Fix Project Properties'
 b) Should be good to go now.
