[Taedium](http://taedium.me) is a service to break the cycle of boredom amongst friends ("I don't know what do you want to do?").
Taedium recommends all kinds of different activities based on any topics you can imagine. Because the database is populated by the 
users, there is no limit to the variety of recommendations you might get. Recommendations can be filtered, liked/disliked and are 
recommended based on your personal tastes.

Note: The current version of the app is pre-alpha, so don't be surprised if not everything is working as it should.
